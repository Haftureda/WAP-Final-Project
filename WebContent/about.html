                We come from many places, cultures, and backgrounds, but share a strong common commitment to personal inner growth, wellness, sustainability, and positive values.

                We support a progressive and inclusive campus culture that’s creative, dynamic, and focused on making the world a better, more peaceful place.
                Through Consciousness-Based Education, you’ll study the subjects you’re passionate about while embarking on a journey of self-discovery and inner growth.
                As your awareness expands, your ability to absorb knowledge and see the big picture improves,
                and you’ll be able to connect what you’re learning in a meaningful way to your own life.

                    <p> Our class schedule incorporates daily practice of the Transcendental Meditation technique, which has been proven to reduce stress, 
                        enhance clarity of mind, and improve overall health.
                         Many of our students find that daily meditation gives them the clear mind they need to 
                         tackle their daily studies and deeply understand complex computer programming dilemmas.</p>
